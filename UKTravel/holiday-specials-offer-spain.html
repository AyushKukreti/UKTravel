						<h1>ABOUT THIS DESTINATION</h1>
						
						<p class="paragraph-description"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishikesh">Rishikesh</a>, is known as the "Gateway to the Garhwal Himalayas" and "Yoga Capital of the World".
                            The city has hosted the annual "International Yoga Festival" on the first week of March since 1999.
                            Rishikesh is a vegetarian-only and alcohol-free city. According to environmental activists, "These camps are not only in violation of Forest (Conservation) Act 1980, but also the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, as well as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, as it is leading to pollution of Ganga by discharging effluent, throwing of solid waste directly and adversely affecting the ecological integrity of the river system."
